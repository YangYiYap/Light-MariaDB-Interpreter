# Light MariaDB Interpreter

This project implements a basic MariaDB-like interpreter as part of the **CCP6114 Programming Fundamentals** course. It supports essential database operations such as:

- Creating and viewing databases and tables.
- Inserting, updating, deleting, and counting rows in tables.
- Viewing tables in CSV format.
- Reading commands from `.mdb` input files and saving outputs to `.txt` files.

The program is designed with error handling and utilizes data structures like `vector` and `map` for efficient data management. It also includes user documentation and sample inputs/outputs for demonstration purposes.
